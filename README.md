# Python Notes

As I've been learning Python my notes where in a mixture of personal projects, code notes and Notion pages. It makes more sense to pull them altogether somewhere that others can see, share and help curate. This is that.

## Structure

### Docs

Some of my notes work best when viewed alongside interactive code examples and some do not need that. This folder contains documents that do not benefit from having the ability to run Python code within them. For example, the guide on how to install Python.

### Example code

Code files or small modules and the like that show example code for given concepts.

### Notebooks

Some of my notes work best when viewed alongside interactive code examples and some do not need that. This folder contains interactive Jupyter notebooks so that I can have live code examples next to my notes. This folder contains the majority of my notes.

## Installing Python

There are numerous ways to install Python on your computer. This [doc](docs/installing-python.md) is the way the I (currently) do this myself.

## Awesome Python resources

Links to Python projects, libraries, frameworks, etc
