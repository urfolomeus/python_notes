# Python Notes

As I've been learning Python my notes where in a mixture of personal projects, code notes and Notion pages. It makes more sense to pull them altogether somewhere that others can see, share and help curate. This is that.

## Structure

### Docs

Some of my notes work best when viewed alongside interactive code examples and some do not need that. This folder contains documents that do not benefit from having the ability to run Python code within them. For example, the guide on how to install Python.

### Example code

Code files or small modules and the like that show example code for given concepts.

### Notebooks

Some of my notes work best when viewed alongside interactive code examples and some do not need that. This folder contains interactive Jupyter notebooks so that I can have live code examples next to my notes.

Check out the [quick guide](docs/using-jupyter-notebooks.md) before using the notebooks for the first time. This will help you get setup and show you how to work with them.

**WARNING** at the time of writing, if you do not open VSCode in the _/notebooks_ folder before using Notebooks then sometimes changes saved to the file are lost when the file is closed. In other situations the file changes were saved, but GitLens did not see those changes.

## Installing Python

There are numerous ways to install Python on your computer. This [doc](docs/installing-python.md) is the way the I (currently) do this myself.

## Python 2 vs Python 3

One of the first things to wrap our heads around is the difference between Python 2 and Python 3, why we need to know and which we should use. See [the doc](docs/python-major-versions.md) for more information.
