# Working with Virtual Environments

The Python community recommends working with Virtual Environments so that your Python projects are isolated from each other dependencies and dependency graphs. There are two ways that we typically interact with virtual environments: managing them ourselves at a low level when we either have basic needs or cannot use higher level options for whatever reason, and having them managed for us by higher level tools such as Anaconda or Poetry.

For the former, I've found this guide to be the most useful source [https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).

For the latter it's best to look to the documentation of that individual tool, i.e. for Poetry see [https://python-poetry.org/docs/managing-environments/](https://python-poetry.org/docs/managing-environments/).
